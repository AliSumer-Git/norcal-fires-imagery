# norcal-fires-imagery
Making open imagery of the October 2017 Sonoma-Napa fires available as slippy maps.

Plan:
- [ ] PENDING: Move all [post-event DG data](https://www.digitalglobe.com/opendata/santa-rosa-wildfires/post-event) to an EC2 instance.
- [ ] Try making some false color tifs.
- [ ] Upload to Mapbox using the [uploads](https://www.mapbox.com/api-documentation/#uploads) API.
- [ ] Make a map with everything, like [this one](https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/robinkraft/cj8nn4lvp7yoq2ro1klhjltw8.html?fresh=true&title=true&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoicm9iaW5rcmFmdCIsImEiOiJQLUp2RU9NIn0.B20c6fiHx0NCgfSOE3HYbw#14.02/38.4891/-122.6985)
- [ ] Blog about what worked, what didn't.
